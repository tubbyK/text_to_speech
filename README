Toy example of using pyttsx to build a off-line text-to-speech program.

For Ubuntu users, libespeak1 and tkinter are needed. You can install them:
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libespeak1
sudo apt-get install python-tk

The voice quality is a lot better on Windows but you might need to use an older version of pyttsx3 if >=2.8 gives an error. You can do so with:
pip install pysstx3==2.71
